# Archery
Archery game written in BASIC for PC-DOS in 1985

A very old DOS game of archery I wrote back in 1985 while bored at a job, waiting to be laid off by the company I was working for that was splitting up.  I liked the arcade game "Track and Field" at the time, but could rarely make it to the really cool archery portion of it.  That is what gave me the idea for this game. 

The original DOS archery.exe exists on several abandonware type sites. You can also play it through a browser on archive.org here:  https://archive.org/details/msdos_Archery_1985

I thought I would post the source for anyone interested. It was originally compiled with the BASCOM compiler. The file here is the DOS BASIC source. It works pretty well running it with GWBASIC under DOSBOX.
